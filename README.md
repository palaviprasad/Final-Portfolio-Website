About Me
Hi! I’m Palavi P., a student developer with a growing passion for building creative, user-friendly web experiences. Over the past year, I’ve been honing my skills in front-end development, exploring HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and basic design principles. I enjoy turning ideas into interactive digital projects that reflect both functionality and thoughtful design.
About This Project
This portfolio is the culmination of my learning and growth as a developer throughout the year. It showcases not only the technical skills I’ve developed but also the creativity and problem-solving I’ve applied to each project. Through this process, I’ve gained a deeper understanding of web development—from planning layouts and structuring content to debugging and refining user interfaces.
